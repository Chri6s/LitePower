var_dump ==== typeof()
variables start with $ in the line
strings are the same
ints are cooler(base 64, hex etc.)
booleans == same as js
array(//gimme them values//) == [] =>
                                        PHP: $fizz = array("buzz"); 
                                        JS: fizz = ["buzz"];
semicolons = nice
from functions you can convert local vars to globals with the "global" keyword
local vars in the functions are del-d after runnin but if we need to save a var from the funtion just type static when declaring the var
