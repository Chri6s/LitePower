## Update
 After 4 years of studying, finally I'm free. Lets get back to this project. My plans are to refactor/redo the entire frame of it, to make it into a web app. It will look like the Tesla Solar app, with the same kind of characteristics, but of course optimalized for web use. This will be fun (I'll be a mental dumpsterfire after finishing it)
